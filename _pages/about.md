Hi, it's Yihan!  

I'm a city planner by training, and a data scientist and urban economist by passion (and quite a bit of training too).  

Currently, I work as a Senior Analyst at [Econsult Solutions, Inc.](https://econsultsolutions.com/) (ESI), a consulting firm specializing in urban economic development. You can explore some of the projects I've worked on (the ones I can share) in the `Project` tab.  

Before joining ESI, I earned my Master's degree in City Planning from the University of Pennsylvania, concentrating in [Public and Private Development](https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/graduate/graduate-city-and-regional-planning-programs). During my time there, I also served as a Research Assistant at [The Housing Initiative at Penn](https://www.housinginitiative.org/), where I contributed to evaluating the COVID-19 Emergency Rent Assistance Program in California.  

Through my academic journey and professional endeavors, I’ve been driven by a singular curiosity: understanding the interplay—sometimes cooperative, sometimes contentious—between public and private forces in shaping urban economic development.  

I believe:  
1. Economic development opportunities should be shared equitably by all.  
2. Housing is a basic human right.  
3. Balancing efficiency and equity is challenging, but it’s a challenge worth embracing.
