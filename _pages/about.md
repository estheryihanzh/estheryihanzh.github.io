Hi, it's Yihan.

I'm a city planner by training, data scientist and urban economist by interest (and also training). 

Currently, I'm working as a senior analyst at [Econsult Solutions, Inc.](https://econsultsolutions.com/)(ESI), a consulting firm focusing on urban economic development. A selection of work products (that I can talk about) is listed in the `project` tab. 

Before my current job, I studied City Planning at the University of Pennsylvania, with a concentration in [Public and Private Development] (https://www.design.upenn.edu/city-regional-planning/graduate/graduate-city-and-regional-planning-programs). I also worked as a Research Assistant at [The Housing Initiative at Penn](https://www.housinginitiative.org/) on the evaluation of the COVID-19 Emergency Rent Assistance Program in California. 

Through my academic and professional experience, I'm always trying to understand the shared interests and conflics between public and private forces in facilitating urban economic development. 

I belive that - 
1. Economic development opportunities should be shared equally by all;
2. Housing is a human right;
3. The balance between efficiency and equitability is hard, but absolutely worth working hard towards.
